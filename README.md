## 🔍 About Me
I’m a Software Engineering student at the University of Information Technology (UIT), passionate about crafting clean, scalable, and human-centered systems. I love turning ideas into real products — not just coding to make things work, but making them elegant, efficient, and maintainable. I enjoy both frontend and backend, with a particular interest in learning architectures that scale well in production and deliver real value to users.  
My approach: Think deeply, build iteratively, learn continuously.

## 🚀 Career Opportunities
I'm currently seeking **Frontend Internship** roles where I can:
- Work with teams that value clean code, design principles, and thoughtful problem-solving.
- Contribute to real products while learning from experienced mentors.
- Get hands-on with real-world deployment, architecture, and scalable systems.

If you're looking for someone who blends technical skills with a strong growth mindset — let's talk!
